# MY-PORTFOLIO
Instructions to save certificate images:

1. For the Oracle SQL certificate:
   - Save the first image (Oracle SQL Certificate from Great Learning Academy) as "oracle_sql_cert.jpg"
   - Place it in the same folder as your HTML file (kamakhya_portfolio.html)

2. For the Python certificate:
   - Save the second image (Python Basic Certificate from HackerRank) as "python_cert.jpg"
   - Place it in the same folder as your HTML file (kamakhya_portfolio.html)

3. Once you've saved both images, the certificate viewing functionality will work when you:
   - Click on a certificate name in the Education & Certifications section
   - A modal window will appear showing the certificate image
   - Click outside the image or on the X to close the modal

This will create a nice, interactive way to showcase your certificates!
